# Credit Analysis  
This analysis was the capstone project from my Advanced 
Topics in Audit Analytics course.  The course was part of 
the Masters of Financial Accounting program at Rutgers 
University. The course covered topics such as descriptive 
statistics up to advanced methods such as association 
rules.  

The overall objective of the analysis was to demonstrate 
the methods learned in the course.  To accomplish the 
objective, I used a dataset from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository.  The dataset included
