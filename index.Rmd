# Credit Analysis  

CreditAnalysis documents the work for the Advanced Topics in Audit Analytics course at Rutgers University.  The course was part of the Masters of Financial Accounting program and covered topics such as descriptive statistics up to advanced methods such as association rules.  

The objective of the capstone project was to demonstrate the methods learned in the course.  To accomplish this I used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and assumed the role of an auditor evaluating a lender's credit approval model.
